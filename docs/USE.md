# Tenjin User Documentation

N.B. Tenjin is still early stage; these notes are not yet complete.
## Translation

```
$ 10j translate \
    --codebase <PATH_TO_PROJECT_DIRECTORY_OR_LONE_C_FILE> \
    --resultsdir <WHATEVER>
```

The `resultsdir` will contain a series of codebase copies as it undergoes
various transformations during translation. The final version of the code
will be contained in a subdirectory called `final/`.

Currently, Tenjin requires either a project directory or a lone C file
(which should be compilable without
any preprocessor definitions or include flags). CMake-based projects will be
configured and built automatically.
For other build systems, there is a `--buildcmd` flag which can, for example,
invoke `make` on a particular target, or using a particular Makefile.
Tenjin will record what files are built and linked,
so as to generate a corresponding Rust project structure.

Because configuration steps often probe host system properties by
compiling and linking synthetic test programs that should not be translated
to Rust, it's usually a mistake to pass `./configure && make` as the
buildcmd. Instead, pass `--prebuildcmd="./configure"`.

Currently, Tenjin requires that the codebase being translated live in a
Git or jj repository, with a remote named `origin`. Information about the
state of the translated repository is embedded into generated JSON metadata
files in the `resultsdir`. This metadata is intended to allow Tenjin's
developers to easily replicate the results of translation. Eventually this
metadata will be made optional/opt-out.

Tenjin has preliminary support for producing Cargo workspaces for projects
which produce shared libraries for internal use. However, many of Tenjin's
automatic improvements are not yet applied to workspaces.

### Tips and Tricks

* When re-running the same translation, you'll probably want
    to pass `--reset-resultsdir`. Otherwise, you'll need to
    provide a fresh results directory every time.
* If you'd like to see the commands that Tenjin is running,
    set the `XJ_SHOW_CMDS=1` environment variable.
* For CMake projects, setting `XJ_CMAKE_PRESET=foo` will pass `--preset=foo`
    during configuration.
* Also for CMake projects, passing `--cmake-define X=V` will set the cache variable
  `X` to `V` during configuration. This may be passed multiple times.

## Guidance

`10j translate` has an **optional** parameter called `--guidance`. It can be
either a JSON literal or a filepath, whose contents should be a JSON object.
The following keys are available:

* `vars_of_type` - a dict with keys as serialized Rust type strings. The
value for each key is either a variable specifier, or a list of specifiers.
A variable specifier is a string like `foo:bar`, which indicates the `bar`
parameter or local variable within the `foo` function. `*:bar` means every
such variable named `bar` in every function.
* `declspecs_of_type` - closely related, but applies to global variables.
* `vars_mut`: likewise, a dict mapping specifiers to boolean values
    indicating whether that declaration should be marked `mut` in Rust.
* `fn_return_type` - a dict mapping function names to the Rust type they should be made to / assumed to return
* `pod_types` - a list of type names which should be considered to
be plain old data, and thereby eligible for type-safe casting with
the `bytemuck` crate.
* `using_crates` - allows the human driver of translation to
specify third-party crates that should be used in the translation.
Currently restricted to a hard-coded list.
* `ffi` - a dict whose keys are function names. Each entry is a dict from
argument names (or the special `$return` string, which denotes the return value)
to an ffi conversion specifier. When any argument or the return value of a
function is given a conversion, Tenjin keeps the translated function as a plain
Rust `fn` (with its guided argument/return types) and emits a separate C-ABI
shim into a `xj_ffi` module. The shim exports the original C symbol,
converts each incoming C value into the guided Rust type, forwards to the real
function, and converts the result back to the C return type. (Variadic
functions and `main` cannot be wrapped this way and are skipped). 
See FFI Guidance below for more information and examples.

  Each specifier is a JSON object with a `"method"` key. The available *argument* conversions (C value into the guided Rust
  type) are:

  * `{ "method": "id" }` uses the value as-is. This is the default when an
    argument is omitted.
  * `{ "method": "to-slice-via-cstr", "mutable": <bool>, "empty-if-null": <bool> }`
    converts a `char*` into a Rust slice (`&[u8]` / `&mut [u8]`) whose length is
    computed with `strlen` (plus one, to include the null terminator). `mutable`
    (default `false`) selects a shared or mutable slice. If `empty-if-null` is
    `true` (default `false`) a null pointer yields an empty slice `&[]` instead
    of being dereferenced.
  * `{ "method": "to-slice", "length": e, "mutable": <bool> }`
    converts a pointer into a slice of length `e`, where `e` is a numeric literal
    or the name of another argument. `mutable` (default `false`) selects a shared
    or mutable slice.
  * `{ "method": "to-ref", "mutable": <bool> }` converts a raw pointer into an
    `Option` of a reference: `*const T`/`*mut T` become `Option<&T>` (via
    `as_ref`, `mutable: false`) or `Option<&mut T>` (via `as_mut`,
    `mutable: true`). Typically paired with `unwrap`.
  * `{ "method": "unwrap" }` unwraps an `Option<T>` into a `T` (via `.unwrap()`),
    e.g. to turn the `Option<&T>` produced by `ref` into a plain reference.
  * `{ "method": "pointer-reinterp", "ty": "T" }` reinterprets a pointer's
    pointee type via `.cast::<T>()`, producing `*const T`/`*mut T`. Use this for
    types with the same representation, e.g. reinterpreting `*const u8` as
    `*const Option<&u8>` where the null-pointer optimization applies.
  * `{ "method": "pipe", "conversions": [ ... ] }` applies a sequence of
    conversions left-to-right, threading each result into the next. For example,
    `pipe` of `ref` then `unwrap` turns a raw pointer into a plain reference.

  The available `$return` conversions (guided Rust value back into the C return
  type) are:

  * `{ "method": "id" }` returns the value as-is (the default).
  * `{ "method": "lift" }` the dual of `unwrap`: lifts `T` to `Option<T>`.
  * `{ "method": "from-slice", "mutable": <bool> }` lowers a slice back to a raw
    pointer via `.as_ptr()` (`mutable: false`) or `.as_mut_ptr()`
    (`mutable: true`).
  * `{ "method": "from-ref", "mutable": <bool> }` lowers a reference back to a
    raw pointer via a cast (`as *const _` / `as *mut _`).
* `no_math_errno` - mostly for debugging/testing. Currently asserts
that no functions in the entire translated codebase make of use
`errno` in the math stdlib.

### Type Guidance

When does it make sense to guide a declaration D to use Rust type T
instead of "raw" type R?

1. at each initialization site (e.g. fn call args and RHSes of let bindings)
   the expression of type R can be transformed into one of type T; and
2. at every use site of D,
    EITHER
        a value of type T can be coerced to one of type R,
        producing a value respecting the same invariants that
        an unguided value would have obeyed,
    OR
        the use expression *and its context* can be altered to avoid
        a coercion to type R.

Regarding invariants: `&[u8]` can safely decay to a pointer, but if the
slice contents are not null terminated, many C string operations will be UB.

The choice of coercion vs context alteration as the baseline approach will
vary per-type. For example, a String in Rust generally cannot safely decay
to a raw `char*` due to the need to maintain UTF-8 contents sans null terminator.
However, a `&[u8]` slice can be coerced to a pointer, assuming that null
terminators are kept.

This implies that Tenjin should handle the two cases differently: for "compatible"
types like `&[u8]`, occurrences should be emitted with coercions to maintain
interoperation with the rest of the translated program. For "incompatible" types
like `&str`, occurrences should be left as-is, so that any residual occurrences
which could not be given special handling will be flagged by the Rust compiler
due to type incompatibilities.

When these conditions are not met, automated translation will not produce a
correct program. Note that one may rationally want to produce an incorrect
translation, if the cost of fixing the unhandled cases from "incorrect" guidance
is lower than the cost of otherwise obtaining an acceptably correct translation.

### FFI Guidance
FFI guidance is at an early stage: at the moment, the following Rust types are not handled as targets (not exhaustive!):
- Owned types (`Box`, `Vec`, `String`)
- `&str`
- Structs/Enums
- `fn` types

In general, we expect that the system will be able to _automatically_ infer how to appropriately
generate FFI wrappers. However, even if the majority cases can be synthesized, there may be cases
where the user needs to provide guidance. For example:

```c
void foo(int *a1, int *a2, int *a3, size_t len1, size_t len2) {...}
```
We need to be able to generate different wrappers for the following cases 
(and this is not immediate from the types of course):
- `a1` and `a2` are arrays of length `len1` and `a3` is an array of length `len2`
- `a1` is an array of length `len1` and `a2` and `a3` are arrays of length `l2`

Examples of applying ffi guidance can be found [here](../tests/snapshotted/ffi_guidance/).

## Preparatory Refactoring and Improvement Passes

Tenjin applies a suite of source-to-source refactorings on C code which help
narrow the semantic gap between C and Rust. The full list can be found in
the `preparation_passes` list within [translation_preparation.py](/cli/translation_preparation.py).
Some notable passes:

- [convert union bitcasts](passes/convert_union_bitcasts.md)
- [errno localization](passes/errno_localization.md)
- [K&R syntax elimination](passes/knr_elimination.md)
- [mutable global localization](passes/mutable_global_localization.md)
- [pointer arithmetic reduction](passes/pointer_arithmetic_reduction.md)

Tenjin also applies a suite of transformations on the generated Rust code to improve its
safety and/or idiomaticity:

- trimming of unused functions and types
- removal of unnecessary `unsafe` markers
- [aliased argument lifting](passes/aliased_arguments.md)
- removal of trivial numeric casts
- `clippy fix` suggestions

The full list can be found in the `improvement_passes` list within
[translation_improvement.py](/cli/translation_improvement.py)


## Coverage

Tenjin provides support for collecting and manipulating coverage
data for translated code---both (output) Rust and (input) C. This
support comes in the form of two subcommands: `10j covset-gen` and
`10j covset-eval`.

### `10j covset-gen`

After performing a translation with a command like

```sh
10j translate --codebase CODEBASE \
              --resultsdir RESDIR
```

one can run the C code and generate coverage:

```sh
10j covset-gen --codebase CODEBASE \
               --resultsdir RESDIR \
               --target EXENAME \
               --output WHATEVER.json \
               ...args for target binary...
```

Notes:

- The options may be passed in any order.
- The `--target` option is only needed for codebases that build
  multiple binaries. The target name may depend on Tenjin implementation
  details; if the name provided cannot be found, Tenjin will report
  which binaries it considered.
- If the target binary needs to be passed a conflicting argument,
precede that target's args with a lone double-dash (`--`).
- To generate a HTML coverage file next to the JSON, pass `--html`.
- To exercise the generated Rust code instead of the input C,
  pass `--rust`.
- The output JSON file will be restricted to the directly translated
  C or Rust code. However, the HTML report will include code from
  imported crates as well.

The output JSON file is in Tenjin's "covset" format.
It can be viewed and manipulated with the companion subcommand,
`10j covset-eval`.

### `10j covset-eval`

A covset file contains a bitmap for a particular codebase.

The `10j covset-eval` subcommand evaluates s-expressions consisting
of unary and binary set operators (`negate`, `union`, `intersection`, `difference`, `symmetric_diff`) over covset files.
There is also a `show` primitive, for viewing the contents of the
codebase annotated with the computed covset data, and `cat` for
emitting the raw underlying (or computed) JSON.

The covset file contains machine-specific paths, but also SHA256 hashes
of file contents, so they could (in a future Tenjin version) be
automatically matched to files on other machines.

### Coverage Demo

```sh
$ cat > xj_covset_demo.c <<EOF
  void puts(const char*);
  int main(int argc, char** argv) {
    puts("first line, always\n");

    if (argc > 2) {
      // oho!
      puts("second line..."
           "sometimes\n");
    }
    return 0;
  }
EOF

$ 10j translate --codebase xj_covset_demo.c --resultsdir xj-cdr
...

$ 10j covset-gen --codebase xj_covset_demo.c --resultsdir xj-cdr \
               --target xj_covset_demo.exe --output x.json
first line, always

$ 10j covset-eval '(show x.json)'
----------------------------------------
File: /PATH/TO/xj-cdr/c_02_build_coverage/xj_covset_demo.c
----------------------------------------
    void puts(const char*);
+   int main(int argc, char** argv) {
+     puts("first line, always\n");
  
+     if (argc > 2) {
  	    // oho!
-       puts("second line:"
-            "sometimes\n");
-     }
+     return 0;
+   }

========================================
Total covered lines: 5 / 8 = 62.50%

$ 10j covset-eval '(show (negate x.json))'
----------------------------------------
File: /PATH/TO/xj-cdr/c_02_build_coverage/xj_covset_demo.c
----------------------------------------
    void puts(const char*);
-   int main(int argc, char** argv) {
-     puts("first line, always\n");
  
-     if (argc > 2) {
  	    // oho!
+       puts("second line:"
+            "sometimes\n");
+     }
-     return 0;
-   }

========================================
Total covered lines: 6 / 8 = 75.00%

```

The file contains 11 total lines, but only 8 of them are considered
to be potentially executable by LLVM. In the first example, we see
five lines that were executed: main, the first puts, the comparison,
the return statement, and (according to LLVM, at least) the final curly brace.
There are three lines that are considered executable-but-not-executed,
and three that could not be covered by any execution.

When we inspect the negated covset, only the three uncovered lines are
printed as covered, but the "Total covered lines" indicates that all six
uncovered lines from before are now considered covered --- even the lines
for which printing was suppressed due to being considered un-executable.

We can then re-run our program to get a new coverage set, and manipulate them:

```sh
$ 10j covset-gen --codebase xj_covset_demo.c --resultsdir xj-cdr --output x2.json --target xj_covset_demo.exe one two three
first line, always

second line:sometimes

$ 10j covset-eval '(show (difference x2.json x.json))'
----------------------------------------
File: /PATH/TO/xj-cdr/c_02_build_coverage/xj_covset_demo.c
----------------------------------------
    void puts(const char*);
-   int main(int argc, char** argv) {
-     puts("first line, always\n");
  
-     if (argc > 2) {
  	    // oho!
+       puts("second line:"
+            "sometimes\n");
+     }
-     return 0;
-   }

========================================
Total covered lines: 3 / 8 = 37.50%
```

The total indicates that only three lines were covered by the
second execution which were not covered by the first.

We can then check the coverage of the associated Rust code:

```sh
$ 10j covset-gen --rust --codebase xj_covset_demo.c --resultsdir xj-cdr --output xr.json --target xj_covset_demo_nolines

$ 10j covset-eval '(show xr.json)'

      unsafe {

      }
+ }

========================================
Total covered lines: 24 / 25 = 96.00%
```

## Tenjin's Environment Variables

- `XJ_GENERATED_SOURCES`: a semicolon-separated list of paths to be treated
  as generated sources (e.g. created via `--prebuildcmd`). You might need
  to set this if you see translation fail in `c_02_build_coverage`.


# Edge Cases

Tenjin strives to support a large subset of C, but there are some
limitations to its support:

- Using macros to "hide" punctuator tokens (such as `;` or `,`)
  from source-level analysis can produce incorrect results.

- C files which include the same header multiple times without an include
  guard, or which includes the same declarations in multiple headers that
  make it into the same translation unit, may (in some cases) become
  corrupted during our pre-refold consolidation step, which assumes a
  one-to-one mapping between header-sourced declarations and the headers
  they came from.

- C toolchains permit linking against a shared library via filename or
  via the `-l` flag; the two ways have subtly different semantics but
  are mostly interchangeable. When translating a C codebase, Tenjin
  currently imposes its own semantic interpretation: the `-l` flag is
  for linking system libraries, and filename-based linking is for
  "local" shared objects. The former induce cargo link flag directives
  in `build.rs` and the latter give rise to inter-crate dependencies
  in `Cargo.toml`.

- Tenjin [doesn't yet handle calls to printf/puts which need to return a count](https://github.com/Aarno-Labs/tenjin/issues/264)

- Tenjin doesn't yet handle codebases which build multiple distinct
  libraries with the same initial stem (e.g. `libfoo.so.1.2.3` and also `libfoo.so.1.7.9`, which share the initial stem `libfoo`) at the same time.

# Error Cases

* If you see `gcc: error: unrecognized command-line option ‘-fcoverage-mapping’`
  the project you're trying to translate is using GCC but we require Clang.

* If you see `failed to load manifest for dependency 'ld_linux_x86_64_2'` the issue is probably that the
project's build system is using `gcc` as the linker
driver. For classic Make builds, try passing
`--buildcmd 'make LD=cc'`.

* If you see something like
```
AssertionError: Link command missing target output: InterceptedCommand(entry={'type': 'ar', 'directory': ..., 'arguments': ['.../tenjin/_local/xj-llvm/bin/ar', 'cru', ...
```
the problem is the `u` in the `cru` argument to `ar` -- it prevents Tenjin from being able
to precisely understand what the created archive will actually contain. The `u` flag is
often the default for older Autotools builds. You can often fix the problem by specifying
`AR_FLAGS=cr` when invoking `./configure` (e.g. in `--prebuildcmd`). Alternatively, you
might switch the build to produce/use a dynamic library instead of a static one.

* If the Rust code fails `cargo check` with a message 
 `error[E0425]: cannot find function 'atoi' in this scope`
 the issue may be due to having compiled the C code with a flag like
 `-Wno-implicit-function-declaration` for a file that was missing a required `#include`.
 The right fix is to add the required `#include` and re-run translation.
